## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install Python 3.11 (if you don't have it):
   - Windows: Download the Python 3.11 installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/, run it, check "Add python.exe to PATH", and complete setup. Verify with:
     - PowerShell: `py -3.11 --version` (or `python --version` if `py` is unavailable)
   - macOS: Use the official installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ or Homebrew: `brew install python@3.11`. Verify with `python3.11 --version`.
   - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip`. Verify with `python3.11 --version`. For other distros, use your package manager (dnf, pacman) to install Python 3.11 along with venv/pip.
3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv rl-bootcamp-env
   source rl-bootcamp-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rl-bootcamp-env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Check each lesson's notebook or script for additional setup instructions as you progress.

### Windows setup (PowerShell)

If you are on Windows, you can set up everything from PowerShell:

## How to use the template
The template uses **[Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)** along with **[Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)** for the configuration management. Hydra is a hierarchical confiugration tool and essentially takes care of the tiresome parts like maintaining your configuration and storing it along with the training results. Although the use of hydra might be a matter of taste, we believe it is important to demonstrate its benefits. Configuration management is a highly relevant task that deserves similar attention to that given to the algorithms themselves.

All commands assume you are running from the repository root with the virtual 
Hydra will automatically create output directories under `logs/runs` or `logs/multiruns` depending on whether the job launcher is started in a single or multirun mode. Results and checkpoints are stored by the callbacks defined but the configuration of each run is automatically storeed in the `.hydra` directory. 


### Single run mode
To run the training code in default configuration defined in `train.yaml` just execute the following code with the virtual environment activated:
```bash
python train.py
```

Trainings with an entirely different configuration are done via:
```bash
python train.py cfg=your_config
```

As mentioned hydra brings the benefit of a hierarchical configuration tool, where every key can be overwritten. E.g. let's run the trainig with a differnt enviornment configuration:
```bash
python train.py env=crippled_ant
```
It is very convinient that hydra stores the configuration in the `logs/runs/../<run_dir>` directory along with a list defining the overwritten keys.
 

It is a good praxis to take advantage of the hierarchy by using a well definied default configuration and overwrite only neccessary parts in an experiment file:
```bash
python train.py experiment=your_custom_experiment
```

Let's for example define change of the enviorment configuration entirly and modify some parameters like the number of training evnironments used and a enviroment parameter which is passed to the constructor of the gym enviorment. Be careful not to forget ```# @package _global_``` right before the defaults list, as this tells hydra to merge configurations in the global configuration space.

```yaml
# @package _global_
defaults:
  - override /env: crippled_ant

train_env:
  n_envs: 6           # increase number of training environments
  env_kwargs:
    injury: medium    # disable two instead of one leg

# define a proper task name making it easier to link results with configurations
task_name: "train_${env.id}_${env.train_env.env_kwargs.injury}"
```

### Multirun mode (-m)
One of the major advantages of hydra is that it provides multirun support.
Consider e.g. the follwing case where we want to run the training with three differnt configurations for the learning rate:
```bash
python train.py -m agent.learning_rate=1e-4,5e-4,1e-3
```
Hydra creates now three run directories in `logs/multiruns/...` where the results and configurations stored similar to the single run case.

Per default this jobs are executed sequentally which is not the workflow suited to train reinforcement learning agents. Luckily, this can be very easily fixed since hydra offers several plugins for job launching. Consider e.g. the following configuration for hyperparmeter tuning:

```yaml
# @package _global_
defaults:
  - override /hydra/launcher: ray
  - override /hydra/sweeper: optuna

hydra:
  mode: "MULTIRUN"
  launcher:
    ray:
      remote:
        num_cpus: 4
      init:
        local_mode: false

  sweeper:
    _target_: hydra_plugins.hydra_optuna_sweeper.optuna_sweeper.OptunaSweeper
    n_trials: 20
    n_jobs: 4
    direction: minimize

    sampler:
      _target_: optuna.samplers.TPESampler
      seed: ${seed}
      n_startup_trials: 10
```

```override /hydra/launcher: ray``` essentially tells hydra to use the ray plugin for job launching which is defined below. In the present case we use 4 CPUs. In addition to launcher plugin we also take advantage of the optuna plugin via ```override /hydra/sweeper: optuna``` which gives as access to more elaborated hyperparameter sampling. In the present case we use the TPESampler which comes with a bit of intelligence instead of brute force grid sampling.

The next step now is to define the parameters we want to optimize for which is again best done via an experiment configuration. E.g. let's create a ```hp_ant_baseline.yaml``` experiment file, essentially loading the the relvant plugins via ```override /hparams_search: optuna``` and definig the parameter space for the learn rate and the clip range for PPO which are the parameters in this example we want to optimize for.


```yaml
# @package _global_
defaults:
  - override /hparams_search: optuna

task_name: "hparams_search_PPO@ANT"

hydra:
  sweeper:
    params:
      agent.clip_range: interval(0.05, 0.3)
      agent.learning_rate: interval(0.0001, 0.01)

learner.total_timesteps: 1000000

# Since we optimize for minimum training time we need early stopping defined
callbacks:
  eval_callback:
    callback_on_new_best:
      _target_: stable_baselines3.common.callbacks.StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold
      reward_threshold: 1000
      verbose: 1
```

Again to run the hyperparameter search we just need to run hydra in multrun mode with configuration we defined above.

```bash
python train.py -m experiment=hp_ant_baseline
```
